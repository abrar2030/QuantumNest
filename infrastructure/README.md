# QuantumNest Infrastructure

## Overview

The `infrastructure` directory contains all the infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations and deployment scripts for the QuantumNest Capital platform. This directory manages the platform's cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational components across various environments.

## Directory Structure

```
infrastructure/
├── ansible/
├── kubernetes/
└── terraform/
```

## Components

### Ansible

The `ansible` directory contains automation playbooks for configuration management and application deployment. These playbooks handle:

- Server provisioning and configuration
- Application deployment
- Service management
- Security hardening
- Monitoring setup
- Backup and recovery procedures

#### Key Files and Directories

- `playbooks/`: Task-specific playbooks for different deployment scenarios
- `roles/`: Reusable Ansible roles for common tasks
- `inventories/`: Environment-specific inventory files
- `vars/`: Variable definitions for different environments

#### Usage

To run an Ansible playbook:

```bash
cd infrastructure/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventories/production playbooks/deploy.yml
```

### Kubernetes

The `kubernetes` directory contains Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for container orchestration. These configurations manage:

- Microservices deployment
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Horizontal scaling
- Secret management
- Resource allocation
- Health monitoring and self-healing

#### Key Files and Directories

- `manifests/`: Raw Kubernetes YAML manifests
- `helm-charts/`: Packaged Helm charts for application components
- `kustomize/`: Environment-specific Kustomize overlays
- `config/`: Kubernetes configuration files

#### Usage

To apply Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
cd infrastructure/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

To deploy using Helm:

```bash
cd infrastructure/kubernetes
helm install quantumnest-backend helm-charts/backend
```

### Terraform

The `terraform` directory contains infrastructure as code definitions for cloud resources. These configurations provision:

- Cloud provider resources (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Networking components
- Database instances
- Storage solutions
- Compute resources
- Security groups and IAM policies

#### Key Files and Directories

- `modules/`: Reusable Terraform modules
- `environments/`: Environment-specific configurations
- `variables/`: Variable definitions
- `outputs/`: Output definitions

#### Usage

To provision infrastructure:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform/environments/production
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Environment Management

The infrastructure is designed to support multiple environments:

- **Development**: For active development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live user-facing services

Each environment has its own configuration files and variables to ensure proper isolation.

## CI/CD Integration

The infrastructure components are designed to integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

1. Terraform for provisioning cloud resources
2. Kubernetes for container orchestration
3. Ansible for configuration management

Pipeline configurations can be found in the `.github` directory at the repository root.

## Security Considerations

- Infrastructure code follows security best practices
- Sensitive values are stored in secret management systems
- Network security is enforced at multiple layers
- Least privilege principle is applied to all resources
- Regular security scanning is implemented

## Monitoring and Logging

Infrastructure components include configurations for:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for log aggregation
- Alerting rules for critical events

## Disaster Recovery

The infrastructure includes provisions for:

- Regular backups of critical data
- Multi-region redundancy where appropriate
- Documented recovery procedures
- Automated failover mechanisms

## Contributing

When contributing to the infrastructure code:

1. Test changes in development environment first
2. Document all configuration changes
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Include appropriate comments for complex configurations
5. Update documentation when making significant changes

- See the main README for overall project information
- Refer to the `/docs` directory for detailed technical documentation
- Environment-specific documentation is available in each subdirectory
